# VLab Example

An example of creating and loading your own virtual lab. See [Github Pages](https://ryanpdwyer.github.io/vlab-example) to see the Virtual lab example.


## To do

- [ ] Use Markdown to generate the example webpage (a couple of script tags for the two key pieces of javascript? - or just in 1 or 2 javascript files?)
- [ ] Define the virtual lab in 1 or more JSON files rather than inline in the JavaScript?
- [ ] Use some of the new tools from last summer for automatically generating the JSON?
- [ ] Explain the different files, functions, etc...
